# CivEnchant

Civ Enchant is a complete enchanting overhaul designed for civ-style Minecraft servers running Spigot 1.12. It was borrows from many concepts in other games, like Path of Exile and Black Desert Online which have more in-depth crafting systems than Minecraft.

Civ Enchant introduces more than 20 new enchantments to the game.

Civ Enchant replaces the existing enchanting system with a more in-depth system designed so that enchantment crafting is more in depth, and a higher power ceiling can be attained by dedicated players. It also has a lower barrier to entry, allowing players to try out the new system from the start of the game.

Rather than relying on EXP and enchanting tables, CivEnchant uses an orb-based crafting system. Orbs can be gathered by fighting mobs and bosses, and traded with other players. There are a variety of orbs used for different purposes within the enchanting process.

Civ Enchant relies on an enchantment slot system. CivEnchant uses an enchantment-slot system. Players can increase an items power and add an open enchantment slot by using Infusion Orbs on their items. Infusion orbs are the most common orb drop.

Players can enchant their items with Orbs of Enchantment. These will add two random enchantments to an unenchanted item. Further enchantments can be added with highly-sought Celesital Orbs.

Players can remove enchantments from an item with a Scour Orb.

Players can add an enchantment to an already enchanted item using a Celestial Orb.
